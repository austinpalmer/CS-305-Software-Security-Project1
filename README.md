# CS-320-Software-Security

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**
Artemis Financial was a finacial institution looking for security to be embedded in their existing REST application.

**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**
I did a good job at understanding how the security vulnerabilities match up with the DFD of security and what to check for based on your goals for the application. Software security practices not only save a company money but also secures their data to ensure no one else can get ahold of it.

**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**
The most challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment is understanding what to look for on the report and how to identify false positives.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**
We increased layers of security throughout this course by using certificate/key generators, learning possible vulnerabilties with common code structure, and using the OWASP database to understand these issues. In the future, I will run dependency checks, look up the vulnerabilities, and find a solution to the issue.

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**
I followed the assignment to ensure that I was applying the right security settings and applications in the right places. After refactoring, I ran another dependency check to see what vulnerabilities changed.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**
I used OWASP Vulnerabilites Database, Springboot, Maven Dependency Check which all will be useful in future checks.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**
I understand how to detect vulnerabilites in an application and ways to prevent issues from slipping through. Additionally, I understand how to generate checksums and certifications for authentication.
